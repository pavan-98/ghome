Code for ESP 8266 to Be Operated from Android App / Web / Blynk

There are Many Code Files Which You can Use for Esp Configuration 
All of them are Listed Below Along with Description 

1. Auto Connect Wi-Fi
     - This is the code file to make the esp module a Wi-Fi repeater/Hotspot and Connect to it using other devices and Check the local IP in the Serial Monitor 
     
2. Blynk Server Connect With LCD display
     - IC2 Display used for showing Server Connection and Blynk Configuration.
     
3. Full Local Wi-Fi ESP Configuration For Controlling Devices
     - Controlling the Devices Connected to the relay using the esp device from a android app , the android app is made using MIT app inventor and can be edited there I will attach both the .aia file as well as apk file. Upload this sketch using the Arduino App and check the Serial Monitor for Local IP and input it in the App and You can Directly Control them. 
     
4. Full Local Wi-Fi ESP Configuration For Controlling Devices With Local IP Dispaly in I2C LCD 
     - Controlling the Devices Connected to the relay using the esp device from a android app , the android app is made using MIT app inventor and can be edited there I will attach both the .aia file as well as apk file. Upload this sketch using the Arduino App and check the Serial Monitor for Local IP and input it in the App and You can Directly Control them. Additionally you can Veiw the Local in the LCD.
     
5. OTA Updater (Demostration Upon Original Code)
     - Update or Upload New Code to the Esp Module using the Arduino App without connecting the ESP module manually.
     
6. Web Updater (Demostration Upon Original Code)
     - Update or Upload New Code to the Esp Module using the Local IP and the code will Automatically execute and run itself. First you need to Execute the Code and Save it as a bin file or Extract it from a temp file , google if you don't know to open a temp folder.
